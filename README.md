# DisasterManagement_System

In our System Analysis and Design project, we developed a Disaster Management System designed to improve disaster response coordination in Bangladesh. The system was conceptualized as a centralized digital platform connecting government agencies, suppliers, healthcare services, volunteers, and affected communities through a unified interface. From a technical perspective, we prepared a complete set of system modeling diagrams, including context-level and system-level data flow diagrams, level-1 DFDs for core processes, a class diagram to represent data structures, subsystem use cases, sequence diagrams for process flow, and a deployment diagram outlining system hosting and component interaction.

The system enables real-time management of relief resources, task assignments, medical service requests, and live data monitoring from affected regions. It integrates role-based dashboards tailored for different actors such as admins, volunteers, suppliers, and government authorities, ensuring secure and organized data access. Additionally, a CRUD matrix was constructed to map use cases against system actors, defining their create, read, update, and delete permissions. A feasibility analysis was carried out to estimate development, hardware, and operational costs alongside projected benefits, demonstrating the systemâ€™s financial viability.

To support implementation planning, we developed a detailed work breakdown structure, activity list with dependencies, Gantt chart, network diagram, and critical path analysis for scheduling and resource management. A functional prototype interface was also designed, showcasing modules for resource inventory management, volunteer task tracking, ambulance booking, doctor consultations, and real-time feedback collection. Although predictive analytics was not implemented at this stage, the system was structured to collect and store extensive operational and feedback data for future integration of data-driven decision-making modules.
